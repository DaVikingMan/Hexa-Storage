# Hexa-Storage

What is this app?

This app keeps in account of the dates of matches(by default it is made for storing cricket matches but more types of data can be stored. Different types of data will be added in a later update).

It also keeps in account of the user who created it.

----------------------------------------------------------------

# What else can this app be used for?

This app can be developed into anything that stores stuff like dates, data and something that is stored in files on the computer.

For example-

Someone can take this program as a base and make a football match counter by changing only a few lines of code.

This can also be turned into a application which stores stuff like user data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What is the default format this file was made for?

This file was tested as a .csv format which can be opened in both excel and notepad(or any other apps that can open .txt file extension)

#The default format for writing in this file is-

(User who has created this list)

(Date when this match will happen)

(Team) Vs (Team)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program also generates a pre-list for the user to understand the file format.

You can also open the generated file and open it in any app that can open the specified file format and write lines to it.

All the lines which you have added will appear in the program as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prequisties-

-Write the file path and folder path in the variables (filePath) and (dirs)
-The recommended file extension to create the file is .csv or .txt(.docx might also work)
